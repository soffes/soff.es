There are currently 4 people confirmed. With 8 people, we get a private boat. Ideal group size is 12, and the maximum size is 16.

## Price

==8 days, 7 nights, 5 diving days is **$1,555** for single occupancy.== For double occupancy, it's $1,214/person. For a nondiver sharing a room with a diver, it's $700 for them for the week.

This is the all inclusive resort, diving, national park entry, and sanitation tax. You'll need to book your own flights, and tip isn't included.

If you want extra nights at the hotel, it's $145 per night for single occupancy and $128/person per night for double occupancy. You can shore dive for $9/tank (see below for more on that). If you want to do boat dive extra days, it's $125/day for 2 boat dives.

==To reserve your spot, you'll need to send me a $100 deposit.== Text me or message me on WhatsApp at [415-450-6000](tel:+14154506000). On August 1st, you'll need to pay the rest of your balance. I'll remind you before then.

### Tips

It's recommended to tip $10/tank for the boat crew and $10/day for the shore crew. If you are just doing the main package, that's $150. It's best to bring cash for the tip.

At the end of the week, we'll collect the tips and let the dive company distribute them to the crew. It's best to not bring cash on the boat so it doesn't get wet or misplaced.

## Getting to Cozumel

I highly recommend flying into Cozumel (CZM). It's usually a little more expensive than flying into Cancún (CUN), but it's so much easier.

If you fly into Cancún, you'll have to take an hour bus or taxi ride to the ferry terminal, wait an hour or more, take an hour ferry to Cozumel, and then a taxi to the hotel (and all of that backwards to go home). Definitely worth flying into CZM.

A one way taxi is usually $8 from the plaza to the hotel. It'll be a bit more from the airport though. Taxi drivers prefer cash (USD or MXP).

You don't need to get pesos while you're in Cozumel. Everyone takes dollars. Sometimes there is a small markup if you pay in dollars, but I think it's worth not having to mess with exchanging money.

### Hotel

We'll be staying at [El Cid](https://www.elcid.com/el-cid-la-ceiba-resort-cozumel). It's a really nice place to eat and sleep between diving. The food and drinks are all inclusive. There are some premium dinner options that cost extra if you want.

Wi-Fi is $35 per device for the week.

The easiest way to get to the hotel is take a taxi from the airport (or ferry terminal if you are coming from Cancún). Once you exit security, the last kiosk on the right is the best way to get a taxi.

## Diving

### Drift Diving

We'll mostly drift diving. If you've never done it before, you're about to be so spoiled. We'll all get in together as a group and let the current gently push us along. As a group, we'll stay together and follow the divemaster. When it's time to come up, we'll ascend and the boat will pick us up. So great.

It's recommended that you have your SMB and reel to signal boats where you are ascending. This isn't required since the divemaster will have one.

### Shore Diving

You can do as many shore dives as you want. They are $9. Just let me know at least an hour or two before so I can make sure they have a tank for you.

When shore diving, they only have air tanks with yoke valves.

### Night Dive

We'll do a boat night dive at one least night. It's $85 for the night dive.

Make sure you have at least one dive light and a tank light if you want to do a night dive.

### Nitrox

It's $120 for the week ($12/tank). Let me know before we arrive if you want to use Nitrox.

### Gear

Here's what you'll need:

* Mask
* Fins
* Boots
* BC
* Regulators
* Computer
* Dive light (Recommended but not required during the day. Required at night.)

You may also want a 3mm wetsuit if you get cold. I personally dive with just shorts and a rash guard.

In Cozumel, you're not allowed to dive with a knife, gloves, or reef stick/hook in the national park where we'll be diving. They don't want you to touch stuff.

#### Optional Gear

We'll have the opportunity to dive a [shipwreck](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AM-298). On the wreck, you are allowed to wear gloves. I dive with something like [these](https://amzn.to/3H4L2Fb). The wreck is very rusty so it's good to have them but not required.

If you are going to wear sunscreen, be sure to wear reef safe sunscreen. I've used [this one](https://amzn.to/3iyQ5U4) in the past. Personally, I wear a rash guard and try to stay in the shade on the boat.

You may also want a drybag on the boat. I use [this one](https://amzn.to/3uqKXUS). I usually just put my phone, dry shirt, and sunglasses in it while we're underwater. Some people like to bring a beach towel from the hotel too.

#### Rentals

You can rent any gear you might need. I'd recommend trying not to rent anything if you can help it though. Please let me know what you want to rent before we arrive.
