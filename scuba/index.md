We'll be doing a [NAUI](https://naui.org) open water and Nitrox course.

## Price

**Training:** $1,000. This includes your training materials and phyiscal certification card.

I also strongly recommend getting diving insurance from [DAN](https://dan.org). They really take care of you if anything happens. Plans start at [$40/yr](https://dan.org/membership-insurance/membership/).

You can also purchase [trip insurance](https://dan.org/membership-insurance/travel-insurance/) from DAN if you'd like. They reimburse you if you can't go diving for whatever reason (weather, sickness, etc). Personally, I usually get this.

## Itinerary

First, we'll do a "classroom" session by the pool. We'll review how to configure our gear and go over some important things before we get in the water the next day.

We'll do two 4-6 hour pool sessions.

Next we'll do a total of 4 open water dives across two days.

## eLearning

After we get your deposit taken care of, I'll send you eLearning information. It'll take 6-10 hours. You can get certified as young as 15 years old, so I know you can do it.

## Gear

You'll need to purchase your "personal equipment". I'll provide everything else (except for a wetsuit).

The easiest way to purchase scuba gear is at a local shop. I also like [Dive Gear Express](https://divegearexpress.com). Most higher end scuba things on Amazon are very overpriced.

**I'd expect your total cost to be about $300-500 for all of this.**

### Mask

One of the most important pieces of gear. It's important to get one for scuba diving that has an enclosed nose. You'll learn why this is important in the eLearning. If you plan to get prescription lenses down the road, make sure the mask you select will work with them. (It is common to dive with contacts.)

To purchase a mask, it's best to go to a dive shop and try some on. You'll want to make sure it fits your face. I recommend listening to the experts at your local dive shop.

> I personally dive with a [Scubapro Zoom mask](https://amzn.to/3z3dlPo) with an upgraded fabric strap. Fabric straps are preferred but not required since they are less prone to breaking.

### Fins

To move around in the water, you'll need fins! I require paddle or hinge fins. (No split fins.) Also, you'll need to make sure the fins you get have spring straps (or purchase some compatible spring straps separately for them if you pick some fins that don't come with them).

When purchasing fins, you'll want to make sure your boots fit unless you purchase a full fit fin. It's best to try them on at a dive shop to make sure they fit. I don't recommend full foot fins since you can't use them in cold water.

Here are some I recommend:

* [OMS Slipstream](https://www.divegearexpress.com/oms-slipstream-fins): $163
* [Mares Avanti Quattro](https://www.scuba.com/p-mrsfaqprgbk/mares-avanti-quattro-open-heel-fin-regular-black): $190
* [Scubapro Jet](https://amzn.to/3CWhVjF): $199
* [Scubapro Seawing Nova](https://www.scuba.com/p-scpfsnbllg/scubapro-seawing-nova-open-heel-fins-blue-large): $260
* [Scubapro Go Sport](https://www.scuba.com/p-SCPFGSOTUMD/scubapro-go-sport-fins): $175

> I personally dive with the Quattros or Jets depending on the situation. Slipstream seems like a really good option.

### Boots

You'll need neoprene boots. They are for comfort and warmth. They also protect your feet getting to and from the dive site when you aren't wearing fins. (We'll cover all of that in the eLearning and classroom.)

For warm water, I recommend 3mm short boots. For colder water, I recommend 5mm tall boots. Boots are the least picky thing on this list. Just get whatever fits at your local dive shop.

> I have a few pairs from different brands. Scubapro makes some nice ones, but I also have some cheap ones by XS Scuba that are also fine.

### Snorkel

A cheap snorkel that isn't a "dry snorkel" is best.

* [DGX Ergo Flex](https://www.divegearexpress.com/dgx-ergo-flex-snorkel): $19
* [Amazon](https://amzn.to/3W3rxC7): $16

If you can, get a silicon retainer for it instead of a plastic clip. Those clips break really easily.

> I dive with a more expensive Scubapro one I don't like that much because it was all the dive shop had when I needed one.
