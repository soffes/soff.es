I‚Äôm a software engineer at Apple currently living in San Francisco, CA. [Previously](/blog/2022), I was traveling full time in my DIY camper van üöê

When the iPhone SDK first came out in 2008, I wrote this app called [Bible](https://youversion.com/mobile) that launched on day one of the App Store. There are a lot of people using it now‚Äîwhich is really humbling. I used to own a few companies, freelance, and work at a few startups. Some notable ones are Along, GitHub, Lyft, Canvas, Venmo, and Hipstamatic.
