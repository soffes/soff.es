I am a software engineer mostly working with Apple platforms and the web. Currently, I‚Äôm living in Sausalito, CA. [Last year](/blog/2022), I traveled full time in my DIY camper van üöê

When the iPhone SDK first came out in 2008, I wrote this app called [Bible](https://youversion.com/mobile) that launched on day one of the App Store. There are a lot of people using it now‚Äîwhich is really humbling. I used to own a few companies, freelance, and work at a few startups. Some notable ones are Along, GitHub, Lyft, Canvas, Venmo, and Hipstamatic. [Ask me anything on Twitter](https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?screen_name=soffes) if you‚Äôre curious.
