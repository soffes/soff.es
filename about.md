I am a <a href="https://github.com/soffes" rel="external nofollow">Swift and Ruby engineer</a> and <a href="https://dribbble.com/soffes" rel="external nofollow">wanna be designer</a>. I’m overly passionate scuba diving, backpacking, home automation, woodworking, and motorcycles. I currently live in San Francisco.

When the iPhone SDK first came out in 2008, I wrote this app called <a href="https://youversion.com/mobile" rel="external nofollow">Bible</a> that launched on day one of the App Store. There are hundreds of millions of people using it now—which is really humbling. I used to own a few companies, freelance, and work at a few startups. Notably, <a href="https://lyft.com" rel="external nofollow">Lyft</a>, <a href="https://venmo.com" rel="external nofollow">Venmo</a>, <a href="http://hipstamatic.com" rel="external nofollow">Hipstamatic</a>, and <a href="http://scribd.com" rel="external nofollow">Scribd</a>. I used to work on an app called <a href="https://cheddarapp.com" rel="external nofollow">Cheddar</a> a lot of people used to like. <a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?screen_name=soffes" rel="external nofollow">Ask me anything on Twitter</a> if you’re curious.
