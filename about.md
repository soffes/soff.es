title: About
---

I am a [Swift and Ruby engineer](https://github.com/soffes) and [wanna be designer](https://dribbble.com/soffes). I’m overly passionate about 
scuba diving, backpacking, home automation, woodworking, and motorcycles. I currently live in San Francisco and work at [GitHub](https://github.com/mobile).

When the iPhone SDK first came out in 2008, I wrote this app called [Bible](https://youversion.com/mobile) that launched on day one of the App Store. There are hundreds of millions of people using it now—which is really humbling. I used to own a few companies, freelance, and work at a few startups. Notably, Lyft, Canvas, Venmo, Hipstamatic, and Scribd. I used to work on an app called Cheddar a lot of people used to like.
