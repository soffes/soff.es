# soff.es

This is my [website](https://soff.es). Itâ€™s pretty simple. My blog is at [soffes.blog](https://soffes.blog).

## Running Locally

Get the source:

    $ git clone https://github.com/soffes/soff.es.git
    $ cd soff.es

Get the dependencies with [Bundler](https://bundler.io):

    $ bundle install

Now you can start the server:

    $ bundle exec rake server

Then open [localhost:4000](http://localhost:4000) in your browser to see it running.

If you have issues getting it up and running, [open an issue](https://github.com/soffes/soff.es/issues/new).
